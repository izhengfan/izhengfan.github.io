It is a bit different to do format output of local time in C++ between Windows and Unix like systems. 

Unix version:

```cpp
time_t t = time(NULL);
tm* p = localtime(&t);
char filename[100] = {0};
sprintf(filename,"%d%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d.txt",p->tm_year+1900,p->tm_mon+1,p->tm_mday,p->tm_hour,p->tm_min,p->tm_sec);
```

Windows version:

```cpp
time_t t = time(NULL);
tm p;
localtime_s(&p, &t);
char filename[100] = {0};
sprintf_s(filename, "%d%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d.txt", p.tm_year+1900,p.tm_mon+1,p.tm_mday,p.tm_hour,p.tm_min,p.tm_sec);
```

As you can see, the main difference is `localtime_s` in Win vs `localtime` in Unix (`sprintf_s` in the same way as well). The function `localtime` is considered unsafe by Windows so `localtime_s` is proposed to replace it (refer to [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a442x3ye.aspx)). `localtime_s(&p, &t)` transforms an int number `t`, which is returned by function `time()` and represents how many seconds from 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC) till now, to a structure `p`, which can be easily used for format output of time, as shown in the program above.

It seems C++ 11 introduces some new stuff to handle time issues. Maybe I will look into it some day if I have time.
