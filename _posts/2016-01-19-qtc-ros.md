### Update

Please note that there is now a Qt Creator plugin for ROS development [ROS Qt Creator Plug-in wiki](https://github.com/ros-industrial/ros_qtc_plugin/wiki). Please use this plugin instead, rather than using the method in the following sections.

Note that the debugger may be not permitted to attached to your ROS nodes. In such cases, try revising the `/etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf` file by changing 

```
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1
```

to 

```
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0
```

### Environment 

Ubuntu 14.04, ROS Indigo (Newer versions should be okay). Qt Creator is an open source IDE for C++ project development, which not only supports its native C/C++ project management, but also provides CMake project building and debugging by just openning the main CMakeLists file.

### Installing Qt Creator

In terminal:

	sudo apt-get install qtcreator

To launch Qt Creator, in terminal:

	qtcreator

Note: Qt Creator should be launched in the terminal, rather than clicking the software icon. That’s because terminal will source .bashrc, which contains environmental setup of ROS. Also, according to the ROS Wiki, you can use the following desktop file `qtcreator.desktop`  and use it in your launcher (remember to use `chmod` to make executable):

    [Desktop Entry]
    Exec=bash -i -c qtcreator %F
    Icon=qtcreator
    Type=Application
    Terminal=false
    Name=Qt Creator
    GenericName=Integrated Development Environment
    MimeType=text/x-c++src;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-xsrc;application/x-designer;application/vnd.nokia.qt.qmakeprofile;application/vnd.nokia.xml.qt.resource;
    Categories=Qt;Development;IDE;
    InitialPreference=9

### Configuring Qt Creator for `rosbuild`

`rosbuild` is an old-fashioned building system of ROS. Yet, there are still some packages built with it, for example ORB-SLAM. We use ORB-SLAM as an example.

Preparation:

1. Clone the source code files from ORB-SLAM's [main page](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM).

2. Append ORB-SLAM directory to the `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`, according to the instructions in the main page.

3. Build the Thirdparty libraries according to the instructions in the main page. 


To open the package:

1. Launch Qt Creator through terminal.

2. Type `Ctrl + O` and select `CMakeLists.txt` in the root folder of ORB-SLAM to open. 

3. Qt Creator will automatically parse the source files of the package. You can use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the code implementation (like F2 to go to a class declaration). 

To build the package:

1. In the project configuration, set the build directory and assign CMake argument as `.. -DROS_BUILD_TYPE=Release` (or `.. -DROS_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` if you want to debug the program), as figure below.

    ![Configure CMake](/images/qtc.jpg)

2. Right click on the project directory, and `Run CMake`, as Figure below.

    ![Run CMake](/images/runcmake.jpg)

3. Click `Build` either in right-click menu or on the hammer icon in the left-bottom corner. The action of `Build` is equivalent to command `make` in terminal.


### Configuring Qt Creator for `catkin_make`

`catkin_make` is a new and more recommended built-in tool for ROS project management. As we know, individual packages files are put in the `/src` directory of a workspace directory. The key step in using Qt Creator to configure  catkin workspace is to open the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `/src` root directory. Here the tricky thing is, the initialized workspace contains a symlink of `CMakeLists.txt` which links to a file in the installed directory of ROS. In order to avoid driving QtCreator mad, we must replace the symlink’ed CMakeLists.txt in `catkin_ws/src` with a physical copy of the actual stuff:

    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    ls -l  # Take note of the actual symlink target
    sed -i '' CMakeLists.txt
    ls -l # The symlink should have gone away

After openning the CMakeLists file, configure the build dir to be `catkin_ws/build/ `, right click on the project directory and run CMake (like in `rosbuild` part), and you can see all your source files being parsed and listed in the project management panel. In the building settings, declare the CMake arguments as

    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=../devel
    
And now we are ready to go. Happy coding.
