### What is ROS

ROS is short for 'Robot Operating System'. Simply speaking, it is rather a framework for

- Standardized programs packaging (C++, Python)

- Standardized data abstraction

which bring the goodness of

- hardware abstraction

- standardized communication

### Versions and Platform

The first version of ROS was released in 2007, after which it is updated with about one version for one year.

The latest versions (in the end of 2015) are

- Indigo, for Ubuntu 13.10 - 14.10, recommended for stability

- Jade, for Ubuntu 14.04 - 15.04, recommended for lasted sofeware

There are also versions ARM-based boards. 

For a new hand user, **installing Indigo in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** is recommmended.

### How ROS Works - Computation Graph

Every *node* runs separately, communicate based on

- topics (subscriber vs publisher), or 

- services (service vs service client)

as shown in Figure 1.

### File System - Package

The simplest structure of a ros package:

	my_package/
		CMakeLists.txt
		package.xml

Typical structure of a package:
	
	my_package/
		src/
			1.cpp
			2.cpp
			main.cpp
		include/
			1.h
			2.h
		config/
			camModel.yaml
		CMakeLists.txt
		package.xml


Packages should be put in a catkin workspace like:

	ws_folder/
		src/
			CMakeLists.txt
			package_1/
				CMakeLists.txt
				package.xml
			...
			package_n/
				CMakeLists.txt
				package.xml
				

### How to Initialize and Build Packages

Create a workspace for catkin:

	mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
	cd ~/catkin_ws/src
	catkin_init_workspace
	cd ..
	catkin_make

After building, the workspace looks like

	ws_folder/
		devel/
		build/
		src/
			CMakeLists.txt
			package_1/
				CMakeLists.txt
				package.xml
			...
			package_n/
				CMakeLists.txt
				package.xml

Create a catkin package:

	catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]

e.g.

	catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp


### How to Run

Common commands:

    roscore = ros+core : master (provides name service for ROS) + rosout (stdout/stderr) +
	parameter server (parameter server will be introduced later) 

    rosnode = ros+node : ROS tool to get information about a node. 

    rosrun = ros+run : runs a node from a given package. 

    roslaunch starts nodes as defined in a launch file.
