There is a common property about the skew-symmetric mapping $()^\land$ of a 3D vector:

> For any rotation matrix $\bf R$ and 3D vector $\bf v$, there is always $({\bf R v})^{\land} = {\bf Rv^{\land}R}^{T}$

This property is of wide use in robotic dynamics and state estimation.
This post provides a simple and intuitive proof of it.

We utilize the relationship between the skew-symmetric mapping and the cross product.
It is known that for any ${\bf v,u}\in \mathbb{R}^3$, there is always ${\bf v}^{\land}{\bf u}={\bf v \times u}$.
Therefore, we have

$$
\begin{align}
& ({\bf R v})^{\land} = {\bf Rv^{\land}R}^{T} \\
\Leftrightarrow\quad & ({\bf R v})^{\land}{\bf R} = {\bf Rv^{\land}} \\
\Leftrightarrow\quad &\forall {\bf u}\in \mathbb{R}^3, ({\bf Rv})^{\land}{\bf Ru}={\bf Rv}^{\land}{\bf u} \\
\Leftrightarrow\quad &\forall {\bf u}\in \mathbb{R}^3, ({\bf Rv})\times({\bf Ru})={\bf R(v\times u)}
\end{align}
$$

The last line in the equation above is true base on the invariance property of the cross product under rotation
(check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Algebraic_properties)), i.e.
for any ${\bf v,u}\in \mathbb{R}^3$, there is always

$$({\bf Rv})\times({\bf Ru})={\bf R(v\times u)}$$ 

It can be intuitively comprehended in a geometric perspective:
imagine that ${\bf v,u}$ are two general 3D vectors, and $({\bf v\times u})$ would be a 3D vector 
perpendicular to both of ${\bf v,u}$, with a norm of ${\bf \|v\| \|u\|} \sin ({\bf u, v})$.
If applying an identical rotation to every one of ${\bf v,u,v\times u}$, both of their norms and relative orientations would not change,
hence the cross product of $({\bf Rv})$ and $({\bf Ru})$ is still ${\bf R(v\times u)}$.
