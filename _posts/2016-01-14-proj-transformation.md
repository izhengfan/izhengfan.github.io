### Typical Types of Transformation of 2D Planes

![](/images/proj.jpg)

Key differences about projective and affine transformations:

- projective: lines mapped to lines, but parallelism may not be kept;

- affine: collinearity and parallelism are both kept

### Affine Transformation

A transformation that preserves lines and parallelism (maps parallel lines to parallel lines) is an _affine transformation_. There are two important particular cases of such transformations:

A _nonproportional scaling transformation_ centered at the origin has the form

where `a,b != 0` are the scaling factors (real numbers). The corresponding matrix in homogeneous coordinates is

A _shear_ preserving horizontal lines has the form

where `r` is the shearing factor (see Figure 1). The corresponding matrix in homogeneous coordinates is

Every affine transformation is obtained by composing a scaling transformation with an isometry, or a shear with a homothety and an isometry. 

### Projective Transformation

A transformation that maps lines to lines (but does not necessarily preserve parallelism) is a _projective transformation_. Any plane projective transformation can be expressed by an invertible 3×3 matrix in homogeneous coordinates:

Conversely, any invertible 3×3 matrix defines a projective transformation of the plane. Projective transformations (if not affine) are not defined on all of the plane, but only on the complement of a line (the missing line is "mapped to infinity").

Figure above: In projective transformations (if not affine), a vanishing line in infinity can be warped to be a finite line.

### Perspecive Transformation

The term _perspecive transformation_ is also commonly seen. Perspective transformation projects a 3D geometric object into a 2D plane. It can be seen as a common example of projective transformation. Strictly speaking it gives a transformation from one plane to another, but if we identify the two planes by (for example) fixing a cartesian system in each, we get a projective transformation from the plane to itself, as shown in the figure below.

Figure above: A perspective transformation with center O, mapping the plane P to the plane Q. The transformation is not defined on the line L, where P intersects the plane parallel to Q and going throught O.

What is the main difference between perspectivity and general projectivity? 

> The distinctive property of a perspectivity is thatlines joining corresponding points are concurrent. The difference between a perspectivity and projectivity is made clear by considering the composition of two perspectivities.

>The composition of two perspectivities is not in general
a perspectivity. However, the composition is a projectivity because a perspectivity is
a projectivity, and projectivities form a group (closed), so that the composition of two
projectivities is a projectivity.

This can be illustrated by the figure below:

![](/images/lineprjc.png)

Figure above: A line projectivity. Points {a, b, c} are related to points {A, B, C} by a line-to-line perspectivity. Points {a', b', c'} are also related to points {A, B, C} by a perspectivity. However, points {a, b, c} are related to points {a', b', c'} by a projectivity; they are not related by a perspectivity because lines joining corresponding points are not concurrent. In fact the pairwise intersections result in three distinct points {p, q, r}.
